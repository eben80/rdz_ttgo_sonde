; Add / remove the following two lines for separate fonts partition in flash
; after changes:
; - pio run --target=upload (uploads partition table)
; - pio run --target=uploadfs (uploads file system matching the new partition table)
; if enable also do:
; - pio run --target=uploadfonts (uploads fonts.bin created during the first pio run)
; Then everything should be "back to normal"
