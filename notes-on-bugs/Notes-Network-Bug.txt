We currently use https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32.git#v6.3.1 for platformIO builds

When upgrading to v6.4.0, there is a problem:

If a web browser sends concurrent requests (mainly reproducible with the "config" tab, where the config.html loads two files, rdz.js and cfg.js from SPIFFS),
one of the two often gets garbled (TCP response is missing its first 4 frames)
bad: two TCP packets with 1490 and 1094 bytes (data: 1436 and 1040 bytes)
good: TCP packets with 1490 (5x) and 1094 bytes (data: 1436 and 1040 bytes)

Somehow something seems to go wrong internally in the TCP stack. Not reproducible with a minimalistic example, but happens almost always with the full code base.


Two mitigations:
- Do not upgrade to v6.4.0
- Avoid double request by browser. For this, cache control has been added (useful anyway). Implication: After an upgrade, browser might still use old rdz.js and cfg.js for 15 Minutes.

In v6.5.0 there seems to be another issue: In AP mode the client does no longer get an IP address -- needs to be checked


**

Tested with 6.3.1:

Sometimes, when a AP is turned off (for < 1s) and turned on again, the WiFi produces a Disconnect event (#5) but no Clients cleared event (#3)
In that case, the WiFi state remains connected (as in WiFi.isConnected()), so network is not working, but never reestablished.

fix: added WiFi.mode(0) when event #5 is received.

Still, for each reconnect, there apparently is a memory leak. Heap goes down by 40 bytes for each reconnect.
